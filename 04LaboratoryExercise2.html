            <h3>ABOUT THE WORK</h3>
            <p>
            Women with Baskets, Fish, and Crab was among the favorite paintings of the artist, Anita Magsaysay-Ho, displayed prominently in her living room before 
            finding a home with one of her oldest friends. The piece melds together a celebration of Filipino craft, the strength of Filipina women, and the talent 
            and technique of one of the countrys most celebrated painters. The baskets depicted invoke the industriousness and dedication involved in basket weaving—a 
            practice Anita considered among the most beautiful of Filipino handicrafts. A similar level of mastery and precision was needed to portray these objects. 
            Anita later related that she found the process challenging, with careful work needed to convey the curvature and to capture the interplay of shadows and of light. 
            The original owner of the piece was Mrs. Charito Panganiban Melchor, a childhood neighbor of Anitas whose friendship with the artist would span decades. It was 
            ironically the storm clouds of war that brought these two young women together. In 1941, when the Japanese Imperial Army took over the residence of Dr. Lauro H. 
            Panganiban on Agno Street in Malate, his family was forced to move to a house on Villaruel Street in Pasay. As fate would have it, their new home was just down 
            the street from where Anita lived with her parents.Anita had just returned from her studies at the avant-garde art school, the Cranbrook Academy, in Bloomsfield 
            Hills, Michigan, directed by Eliel Saarinen and where Lazslo Moholy-Nagy of the Bauhaus taught. She would have been brimming with ideas and excited to share them.
             Charito was barely in her teens in 1941; and she recalls walking a block or so with her sister, Pacita, to the Magsaysay house several times a week for their 
             painting lessons with Anita.It would be the start of a 70-year long friendship. Anitas family was a branch of the enterprising Yangco clan. Don Luis Yangco was 
             dubbed the “King of Manila Bay and Pasig” for the number of boats and barges he owned that plied the coast of Luzon.
